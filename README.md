# My Coding Samples and Technical Writings

Welcome to my collection of coding samples and technical writings! This repository is a showcase of my programming skills, knowledge, and ability to explain complex concepts in an understandable manner.

## Overview

The code samples in this repository cover a wide range of programming concepts, languages, and frameworks. They serve as a testament to my ability to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

In addition to the code samples, this repository also will contain a collection of technical writings. These documents provide detailed explanations of the code, making it easier for others to understand how the code works and how to use it.

## Contents

The repository is organized into two main sections:

1. **Coding Samples**: This section contains a variety of code snippets and projects that I've worked on. Each directory within this section corresponds to a specific programming language or framework.

2. **Technical Writings**: This section contains PDF documents that explain the code in the Coding Samples section. Each document provides a detailed walkthrough of a specific code sample, explaining how the code works and how to use it.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the repository and check out the code and documents. If you're interested in running any of the code samples, please ensure that you have the appropriate environment set up on your machine.

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily a personal showcase, I'm always open to learning and improving. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## License

All code and documents in this repository are released under the MIT license. See `LICENSE` for more information.
